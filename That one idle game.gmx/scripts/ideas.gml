My idea here is that you have a choice on what you click, you start with clicking coal, you 
sell it then unlock a new ore or blueprint, then you can make something with the blueprint
or click the new ore, IE: Buy battery blueprint, Click copper, And zinc, then click battery
lose one copper and lose one zinc


you can choose the price and how much you sell of an item, but the higher the price the less
of a chance someones going to buy it, chance is calculated per second.
